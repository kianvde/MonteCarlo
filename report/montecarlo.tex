Monte Carlo integration is based on evaluating the integrand at random points, and then averaging over these points. For higher dimensional integrals this method converges faster than standard numerical methods as the distribution uniformity of the random points is higher than for example a cubical grid. To improve on this integration scheme the integral should be rewritten in a form where we can sample over a distribution close to the shape of the integrand, this ensures that the regions that contribute strongly to the integral are evaluated more exactly. This method is called importance sampling Monte Carlo and will be used in our evaluation of the hydrogen molecule's energy. \\
In our case we would like to sample over  $|{\psi _{tr}}{|^2}$ as it will be close to the integrand in the energy expression $\psi _{_{tr}}^*H{\psi _{tr}}$. To achieve this the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm will be used.
