After setting s the only free wave function parameter left is $\beta$, as explained above. To minimize the energy for beta a damped steepest descent scheme is used. In this scheme $\beta$ is updated according to
\begin{align}
\beta  &= \beta  - \gamma \frac{{d\left\langle E \right\rangle }}{{d\beta }},\\
\frac{{d\left\langle E \right\rangle }}{{d\beta }} &= 2\left[ {\left\langle {{E_L}\frac{{d\ln ({\psi _{tr}})}}{{d\beta }}} \right\rangle  + \left\langle {{E_L}} \right\rangle \left\langle {\frac{{d\ln ({\psi _{tr}})}}{{d\beta }}} \right\rangle } \right],
\end{align}
where we have used $\gamma=0.1$. For our trial wave function only the interaction term depends on $\beta$ so we have
\begin{align}
\frac{{d\ln ({\psi _{tr}})}}{{d\beta }} =  - \frac{{r_{12}^2}}{{2(1 + \beta {r_{12}})}}.
\end{align}
Now $\beta$ and also the acceptance rate can be updated after every M iterations until the local energy converges to its minimum.
